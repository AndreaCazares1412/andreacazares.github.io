            With Kelsey Anderson and Stephanie Ramos, we built different supervised
            machine learning models to test if the text extracted from tweets posted
            by news media accounts is predictive of the polarization in the comments
            they receive. We used logistic regression, recurrent and convolutional neural
            networks to predict polarization in comments with 65% accuracy.
            Our research aims to contribute to creating a more civil and less polarized
            space for discourse on social media.

            To join the efforts to fight COVID-19, along with Roberto Barroso, Steph Ramos and Oscar Noriega,
            I studied and predicted severe disease outcomes for COVID-19 patients in Mexico .
            The predictions were useful in developing a relative risk index between Mexican states.

            In an effort to further study and address mass incarceration in the U.S.,
            I examined the rates of recidivism across several social dimensions such as mental illness prevalence,
            emotional difficulties and family conditions (e.g. foster care, homelessness),
            using the data from the BJS 2016 Inmates Survey.

            Motivated by the growing crime incidence in Mexico City (CDMX),
            this web-app aims to provide the user information on the number of crimes that happened at a
            specified place, day of the week, and hour, with the purpose of the user potentially
            taking certain precautions when going to a specified area given that time and day of the week.

          <p> Through Unity and #C, Kelsey Anderson and I built an Educational video game about Climate Change for 10 to
            12-year-olds. The goal is to provide the children with an understanding of how their behaviors in daily life
            relate to the global environment.

            Together with Enrique Melgar and Mariana Elizabeth Rubio, I built "Focus Travel,"

            <a href="https://www.digitalhouse.com/mx"> Digital House. </a> 
            Throughout this project, I actively contributed to all stages of the development cycle, 
            from planning to deployment. We utilized agile methodology to efficiently meet project objectives, 
            ensuring timely delivery and collaboration. 
            Through this experience, I gained hands-on skills in various tools and technologies (e.g., React.js, Node.js, Git, MySQL).
